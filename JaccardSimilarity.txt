I use pure java to calculate the Jaccard similarity of two Strings.

To calculate the Jaccard similarity between two strings in Java, weâ€™ll interpret the algorithm and refine it slightly to work as expected:
    Convert both strings to uppercase.
    Represent each string as a set of characters to ensure unique characters are considered.
    Count the intersection (common characters) and the union of both sets.
    Calculate Jaccard similarity as the ratio of the intersection size to the union size.
Explanation of the Code
    Uppercase Conversion: Both input strings are converted to uppercase to make the comparison case-insensitive.
    Set Usage: set1 and set2 hold unique characters from each string.
    Intersection and Union:
        intersection set is created by retaining only the common elements between set1 and set2.
        union set is created by adding all elements from set1 and set2.
    Jaccard Similarity Calculation: Jaccard similarity is calculated as the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union.
